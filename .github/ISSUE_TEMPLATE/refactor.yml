        Currently, we use a combination of `class-validator` and `class-transformer` libraries to validate data in the backend service. There are several problems with using these libraries:

        - Writing a new validator is complicated because it requires knowledge of how decorators work in TypeScript.
        - Libraries do not provide type safety.

        For some time, the `zod` library has been available in the npm environment. This library does not use decorators and provides 100% type safety of validated objects.
